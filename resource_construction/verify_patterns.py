"""
Requires a list of regexes that have been manually defined by a user.
Verifies how common pattern names are and sorts them in descending order.

Requires "patterns.txt" in base folder, and list of names in "resources/top_names.csv"

This produces the pattern name ranking used for the feature extraction.
