"""
Iterates though an alphabetical list of unique cookie names, picks out those names that share a great
degree of similarity in a contiguous sequence. This is used to determine cookie names that follow a
certain pattern. After extraction, manual work is needed to determine which names out of the filtered
list are truly pattern names, and additional work needs to be done to define a regex pattern for them.

These pattern names are then used for the feature extraction.

Requires name extraction script to be executed first.
